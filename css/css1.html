                        Sunset is the time of day when our sky meets the outer space solar winds.
                        There are blue, pink, and purple swirls, spinning and twisting, like clouds of
                        balloons caught in a <mark style="background-color: #39ff14;">whirlwind. The sun moves slowly to hide behind the line
                        of horizon, while the moon </mark>races to take its place in prominence atop the night
                        sky. People slow to a crawl, entranced, fully forgetting the deeds that must still
                        be done. There is a coolness, a calmness, when the sun does set.

                        On July 16, 1969, the Apollo 11 spacecraft launched from the Kennedy Space
                        Center in Florida. Its mission was to go where no human being had gone
                        before—the moon! The 
                        <span style="font-weight: bold; background-color: red;">crew consisted of Neil Armstrong, Michael
                            Collins, and Buzz Aldrin. The spacecraft 
                        </span>
                        landed on the moon in the Sea of
                        Tranquility, a basaltic flood plain, on July 20, 1969. The moonwalk took place
                        the following day. On July 21, 1969, at precisely 10:56 EDT, Commander Neil
                        Armstrong emerged from the Lunar Module and took his famous first step
                        onto the moon’s surface. He declared, “That’s one small step for man, one
                        giant leap for mankind.” It was a monumental moment in human history!
